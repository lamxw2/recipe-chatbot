        Hi! I'm ____. 
        I can chat about healthy eating habits and dietary information, suggest recipes, 
        provide suggestions on how to improve your current meals, or inform about food safety. 
        \n \n
        What would you like to talk about?

  utter_introduce_healthy_eating:
    - text: Food can be categorized into 6 core groups - vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods and oils.
  utter_healthy_eating_veg_intro:
    - text: |
        Vegetables can be further categorized into 6 subgroups - dark-green, red and orange,  
        beans, peas and lentils (pulses), starchy, and others.  
        \n
        Most adults should consume between 2-4 cups equivalent, or as part of their 5 a day,  
        with each portion being 80g.
  utter_healthy_eating_fruit_intro:
    - text: > 
        You should eat between 1.5-2.5 cups equivalent or as part of your 5 a day. \ 
        Just like with vegetables, with each portion of fruit is 80g.  \ 
        100% fruit juice counts as 1 of 5 a day, but limited to only 150ml each day.
  utter_healthy_eating_grains_intro:
    - text: > 
        At least half of your daily grain intake should be whole grain. \ 
        Aim to have 5-10 ounces of grains a day!
  utter_healthy_eating_dairy_intro:
    - text: > 
        Milk, yoghurt, cheese (including lactose-free versions), \
        fortified soy beverages and yoghurt are considered dairy products. \n
        You should have 3 cups equivalent of dairy a day.
  utter_healthy_eating_proteinfoods_intro:
    - text: > 
        Protein foods can be further categorized into 4 subgroups -  \ 
        lean meat, poultry, eggs; seafood; beans, peas and lentils (pulses); nuts, seeds and soy products. \n
        You should be consuming 5-7 ounces of protein foods a day. \n 
        At least 2 portions of fish should be eaten every week, \ 
        and 1 portion should be an oily fish (e.g. salmon, mackerel). \n 
        A portion is around 140g (4.9oz). \ 
        However, you should not exceed 90g of red meat in a day! \n
        The recommended guideline is 70g a day. \n
        90g of red meat is equivalent to three thinly cut slices of beef, lamb or pork, \ 
        where each slice is about the size of half a piece of sliced bread. \n
        A cooked breakfast containing two typical British sausages and two rashers of bacon is equivalent to 130g.
  utter_healthy_eating_oils_intro:
    - text: > 
        The main types of fat found in food are saturated and unsaturated. \ 
        Saturated fat is found in animal sources, and unsaturated is found in plant sources. \n
        Aim to consume more healthy oils such as vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts,  \
        and reduce oil consumption from animal sources!  \n
        Try not to exceed 22-44g of oil a day.

  utter_introduce_food_safety:
    - text: >
        Different types of food have different food safety rules. \ 
        I can tell you about meat, seafood, rice, eggs, dairy, and fruits and vegetables. \n
        For each type, there are \n
        What would you like to learn more about?

  utter_defrost_safety_intro:
    - text: |
        Make sure to only defrost the amount you need! Do NOT re-freeze raw food after it has thawed completely.
        Choose a method that keeps food out of the 'danger zone' temperature (40F to 140F, or 5c to 60c).
        Bacteria multiply rapidly in 'danger zone' temperatures!

  utter_defrost_safety_conclusion:
    - text: >
        Contrary to popular belief, it is unsafe to thaw food by leaving it out at room temperature for hours!
        It brings food up to 'danger zone' temperatures.
        Most bacteria and their toxins can be destroyed from cooking food to safe temperatures, with one exception.
        The toxins from the Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria is heat-resistant and cannot be destroyed by cooking.

  utter_defrost_safety_general:
    - text: >
        As a general rule, most food can be safely thawed in 3 ways:
        1. Slowly in the refrigerator overnight. 
        2. In running water, with extra precautions for meat and seafood to prevent cross-contamination. 
        3. Using the defrost setting on the microwave. Move the food around often in the dish holding it to ensure it defrosts evenly!
        When defrosting fish in the microwave, stop when it is icy but still pliable.
        Extra care has to be taken when defrosting meat. Feel free to ask me about it to find out more!

  utter_defrost_safety_meat:
    - text: >
        Ensure that the meat is properly sealed in a container or bag to prevent contaminating other food or surfaces.
        Meat can be safely thawed in 3 ways:
        1. Slowly in the refrigerator, over several hours. Make sure you plan ahead!
        Large cuts of meat such as a whole chicken or turkey can take at least 24 hours to thaw.
        A pound (approximately 450g) of smaller or thinner cuts of meat such as diced chicken or minced beef could still take a full day to thaw.
        When thawing in the fridge, keep it on the lowest shelf so liquid does not drip onto other food.
        Make sure to cook the thawed meat!
        2. In running water, or by submerging in cold tap water and changing the water every 20-30 minutes.
        Make sure the meat is in a sealed package - to prevent it from contaminating the sink, and prevent bacteria contaminating the meat!
        Changing the water frequently ensures the meat continues to thaw, as the water turns cold from the frozen meat and halts or slows down the thawing process.
        Avoid using warm water as it will cause the meat to thaw unevenly, with the outer parts warming up quicker than the inner parts. It may cause the outer parts to enter 'danger zone' temperatures (40F to 140F or 5c to 60c).
        A pound (approximately 450g) of meat may take an hour or less to thaw, while 3-4 pounds (1.3-1.8kg) of meat may take 2 to 3 hours.
        For a whole turkey, it may take 30 minutes per pound.
        3. In the microwave.
        This is the quickest way, but you have to cook the food immmediately after thawing!
        Move the food around often in the dish holding it to ensure it defrosts evenly.
        The outer parts may start to cook within 'danger zone' temperatures without destroying bacteria and toxins, so be careful to prevent cross-contamination!
        
  utter_defrost_safety_cookfromfrozen:
    - text: >
        If you're in a hurry, frozen vegetables, fruit, meat, seafood or even dough can be safely cooked from frozen!
        If they're in smaller pieces, they'll take less time to cook from frozen than if they were in big pieces. 
        As long as meat and seafood reach a safe internal temperature, they are safe to cook from frozen.
        Always follow packaging instructions if any!
