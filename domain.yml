        Hi! I'm CoCo, the cooking companion. 
        I can chat about healthy eating habits and dietary information or suggest recipes. Tell me what you would like to talk about!
        If you're unsure about what to do, try asking for 'help'.

        To ask for information about healthy eating, try asking something like:
        "What is a balanced diet?"
        "How much meat should I eat a day?"
        "What are examples of dark green vegetables?"
        To ask for recipe suggestions, try:
        "Give me a recipe with soup"
        "Show me how to make a chicken sandwich"
        "Can you show me how to make Indian curry?"
        I hope you have fun :)
