    - text: Food can be categorized into 6 core groups - vegetables, fruits, grains, dairy, protein foods and oils.
  utter_healthy_eating_veg_intro:
    - text: |
        Vegetables can be further categorized into 6 subgroups - dark-green, red and orange,  
        beans, peas and lentils (pulses), starchy, and others.  
        \n
        Most adults should consume between 2-4 cups equivalent, or as part of their 5 a day,  
        with each portion being 80g.
  utter_healthy_eating_fruit_intro:
    - text: > 
        You should eat between 1.5-2.5 cups equivalent or as part of your 5 a day. \ 
        Just like with vegetables, with each portion of fruit is 80g.  \ 
        100% fruit juice counts as 1 of 5 a day, but limited to only 150ml each day.
  utter_healthy_eating_grains_intro:
    - text: > 
        At least half of your daily grain intake should be whole grain. \ 
        Aim to have 5-10 ounces of grains a day!
  utter_healthy_eating_dairy_intro:
    - text: > 
        Milk, yoghurt, cheese (including lactose-free versions), \
        fortified soy beverages and yoghurt are considered dairy products. \n
        You should have 3 cups equivalent of dairy a day.
  utter_healthy_eating_proteinfoods_intro:
    - text: > 
        Protein foods can be further categorized into 4 subgroups -  \ 
        lean meat, poultry, eggs; seafood; beans, peas and lentils (pulses); nuts, seeds and soy products. \n
        You should be consuming 5-7 ounces of protein foods a day. \n 
        At least 2 portions of fish should be eaten every week, \ 
        and 1 portion should be an oily fish (e.g. salmon, mackerel). \n 
        A portion is around 140g (4.9oz). \ 
        However, you should not exceed 90g of red meat in a day! \n
        The recommended guideline is 70g a day. \n
        90g of red meat is equivalent to three thinly cut slices of beef, lamb or pork, \ 
        where each slice is about the size of half a piece of sliced bread. \n
        A cooked breakfast containing two typical British sausages and two rashers of bacon is equivalent to 130g.
  utter_healthy_eating_oils_intro:
    - text: > 
        The main types of fat found in food are saturated and unsaturated. \ 
        Saturated fat is found in animal sources, and unsaturated is found in plant sources. \n
        Aim to consume more healthy oils such as vegetable oils and oils in food such as seafood and nuts,  \
        and reduce oil consumption from animal sources!  \n
        Try not to exceed 22-44g of oil a day.
