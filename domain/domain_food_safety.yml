        Different types of food have different food safety rules. \ 
        I can tell you about meat, seafood, rice, eggs, dairy, and fruits and vegetables. \n
        For each type, there are \n

        Make sure to only defrost the amount you need! Do NOT re-freeze raw food after it has thawed completely.
        Choose a method that keeps food out of the 'danger zone' temperature (40F to 140F, or 5c to 60c).
        Bacteria multiply rapidly in 'danger zone' temperatures!

        Contrary to popular belief, it is unsafe to thaw food by leaving it out at room temperature for hours!
        It brings food up to 'danger zone' temperatures.
        Most bacteria and their toxins can be destroyed from cooking food to safe temperatures, with one exception.
        The toxins from the Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria is heat-resistant and cannot be destroyed by cooking.

        As a general rule, most food can be safely thawed in 3 ways:
        1. Slowly in the refrigerator overnight. 
        2. In running water, with extra precautions for meat and seafood to prevent cross-contamination. 
        3. Using the defrost setting on the microwave. Move the food around often in the dish holding it to ensure it defrosts evenly!
        When defrosting fish in the microwave, stop when it is icy but still pliable.
        Extra care has to be taken when defrosting meat. Feel free to ask me about it to find out more!

        Ensure that the meat is properly sealed in a container or bag to prevent contaminating other food or surfaces.
        Meat can be safely thawed in 3 ways:
        1. Slowly in the refrigerator, over several hours. Make sure you plan ahead!
        Large cuts of meat such as a whole chicken or turkey can take at least 24 hours to thaw.
        A pound (approximately 450g) of smaller or thinner cuts of meat such as diced chicken or minced beef could still take a full day to thaw.
        When thawing in the fridge, keep it on the lowest shelf so liquid does not drip onto other food.
        Make sure to cook the thawed meat!
        2. In running water, or by submerging in cold tap water and changing the water every 20-30 minutes.
        Make sure the meat is in a sealed package - to prevent it from contaminating the sink, and prevent bacteria contaminating the meat!
        Changing the water frequently ensures the meat continues to thaw, as the water turns cold from the frozen meat and halts or slows down the thawing process.
        Avoid using warm water as it will cause the meat to thaw unevenly, with the outer parts warming up quicker than the inner parts. It may cause the outer parts to enter 'danger zone' temperatures (40F to 140F or 5c to 60c).
        A pound (approximately 450g) of meat may take an hour or less to thaw, while 3-4 pounds (1.3-1.8kg) of meat may take 2 to 3 hours.
        For a whole turkey, it may take 30 minutes per pound.
        3. In the microwave.
        This is the quickest way, but you have to cook the food immmediately after thawing!
        Move the food around often in the dish holding it to ensure it defrosts evenly.
        The outer parts may start to cook within 'danger zone' temperatures without destroying bacteria and toxins, so be careful to prevent cross-contamination!

        If you're in a hurry, frozen vegetables, fruit, meat, seafood or even dough can be safely cooked from frozen!
        If they're in smaller pieces, they'll take less time to cook from frozen than if they were in big pieces. 
        As long as meat and seafood reach a safe internal temperature, they are safe to cook from frozen.
        Always follow packaging instructions if any!
